           <h2 class="h2">Computer,in this day and age have become essential.their used<br> in almost every field 
               there is.from health care to entertainement <br>to space adventure.all of these things are possible
                only due to com<br>-puters. I would even argue that computer is humanities greatest <br>creation
               computer have even created new posibilities for creation <br>of robots. humaniy has also  
               gone to space because of rocket which<br> are also only possible due to computer. computers have even
               been <br>implemented as a school subject.the reason why computer program<br>-mers get so much more money 
               than other jobs is because of its imp<br>-ortance and potential for improvement in the future.
