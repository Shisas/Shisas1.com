                Possibilities of computer are endless. right now people are trying<br> to 
                created robot,humanoid robots to be exact. they are said to be <br>the 5th generation
                of computer. they are said to have the abilities<br> to express human emotions and 
                aside from robots. through the po<br>-wer of computers we will be about to communicate with just our<br> brains and can
                put information in our brain just by inserting chips<br>.so, we can be one with robots.

               <p>
                however not everything is well and good with future of computers.<br>some speculate that robots might become more intelligent
                than hu<br>-man and might try to destroy mankind.however, its just a theory.A <br>real issue that we can experience is that 
                humans can become too re<br>-liant on robots which might make them lazy. we must try to find so<br>-lutions to these problems else 
                computers can become a detriment<br> rather than an advantage.
